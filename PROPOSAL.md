# Project Proposal — Predicting Stock Returns from Twitter Sentiment

Over the past few years, the growing influence of online platforms has significantly changed how investors react to financial information. Among these platforms, **Twitter** has become a space where market participants, journalists, and the general public share their views on economic news, company results, and political events. These collective reactions may contribute to shaping investor sentiment and could potentially influence short-term market movements. Understanding whether such online emotions can help anticipate financial trends has become increasingly relevant in the context of modern financial analysis.

This project aims to explore whether **sentiment extracted from Twitter** can help predict the **short-term returns of 6 major NASDAQ companies**: Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), and Microsoft (MSFT). The objective is to assess whether combining sentiment information with traditional technical indicators improves the ability to anticipate price direction. Rather than focusing only on statistical correlations, the study approaches the problem through a **machine learning framework**, where multiple models are trained and backtested to predict future movements based on both sentiment and financial indicators.

The project will rely on historical stock data (2015–2019) and a collection of financial tweets from **Kaggle datasets** related to these companies. The tweets will be processed and analyzed using **FinBERT**, a language model designed to interpret financial text and identify whether messages express positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. These results will then be merged with daily stock information to build a dataset suitable for prediction tasks.

Several **machine learning algorithms**, including **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks, will be tested and compared to evaluate their predictive capacity using **backtesting strategies**. Each model will be trained with two feature sets: technical indicators alone and technical + sentiment features combined. The analysis will aim to determine whether social media sentiment provides additional insight into stock behavior and whether it can improve short-term return forecasts.

Ultimately, this work seeks to combine methods from **data science and behavioral finance** to better understand the relationship between collective online behavior and individual stock dynamics. The findings could contribute to a broader understanding of how information and emotion circulate between digital platforms and financial markets.
