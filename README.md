## Abstract

This project investigates whether **Twitter sentiment** can enhance the **prediction of short-term movements** in the **NASDAQ Composite Index**.  By combining **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with **machine learning**, it explores whether the tone of online discussions about major NASDAQ-listed companies — such as Apple, Tesla, and Amazon — provides useful signals for forecasting daily market direction.  

Using the **FinBERT** transformer model for financial sentiment extraction and merging these results with historical market data from **Yahoo Finance**, this project integrates behavioral finance concepts into a predictive data science framework.

## 1. Context and Motivation

The behavior of financial markets is increasingly influenced by collective sentiment expressed online. Platforms like **Twitter** serve as real-time barometers of investor mood, where reactions to corporate news, political announcements, or macroeconomic trends can spread instantly.  

This project applies principles of **behavioral finance** and **machine learning** to examine whether aggregated sentiment from Twitter can improve the predictive modeling of short-term changes in the NASDAQ index. Rather than describing correlations, it aims to evaluate the **predictive contribution** of sentiment compared to traditional market indicators.

## 2. Research Objective

The main goal is to determine whether **social media sentiment** provides **additional predictive power** when forecasting daily NASDAQ movements.  

Specifically, the project compares two modeling approaches:
- A **baseline model** using only technical indicators (returns, moving averages, volatility).  
- A **hybrid model** that integrates both technical and sentiment-based features.

Machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** will be trained and evaluated on historical data to test this hypothesis.

## 3. Methodology Overview

The project follows a reproducible workflow combining NLP, financial feature engineering, and supervised learning.

1. **Data Collection & Preparation**  
   Historical NASDAQ data (2015–2020) retrieved via `yfinance`.  
   Financial tweets from **Kaggle datasets** related to major NASDAQ-listed companies (see section 7).  
   Merging tweet timestamps with daily market data.
   

3. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   Application of **FinBERT** to classify tweets as positive, neutral, or negative.  
   Daily aggregation of sentiment metrics (average score, sentiment proportions and polarity level).  

4. **Feature Engineering & Modeling**  
   Merge sentiment and market indicators into a unified dataset.  
   Train **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** to predict next-day market direction.  
   Compare predictive performance with and without sentiment features.

5. **Evaluation & Interpretation**  
   Temporal validation (training 2015–2018, testing 2019–2020).  
   Performance measured using classification accuracy and feature importance analysis.  
   Visualization of sentiment versus market movements.
